## Building & Elevator System Simulation

OVERVIEW:
This project simulates an elevator system using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to demonstrate the software to potential clients. The application models multiple elevators operating within a building, handling requests and displaying the current status of each elevator, including position, direction, operational status, and scheduled stops.

## FEATURES:
- Interactive GUI using Java Swing that displays the status of each elevator in the building.
- Real-time updates reflecting the model's state in response to user actions or system events.
- Controls to start a new simulation, and manage elevator operations including start, stop, and out of service.
- Step button to advance the simulation manually and see the immediate effects on the elevator system.

## HOW TO RUN:
- To run the application, execute the provided BuildingSystem.jar file in the res folder. Ensure Java is installed on your machine.
- Please ensure Java is correctly installed on your system to run the application without issues. Test the JAR file outside the development environment to confirm its portability.
## HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM:
- Upon launching the application, you will see the main window displaying the elevator statuses.
- Use the "Start" button to initiate the simulation with default or specified parameters.
- "Step" button can be used to manually step through the simulation, updating the view with each press.
- Elevators can be put out of service or returned to service as needed during the simulation.

## DESIGN/MODEL CHANGES:
- Transitioned to an MVC architecture to decouple logic and presentation, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
- Enhanced error handling and user input validation to prevent and manage operational exceptions.

## ASSUMPTIONS:
- All inputs are valid integers representing floors within the building's range.
- Elevators start from the ground floor.
- Simulation does not account for real-time delays, simulating movement instantaneously.

## LIMITATIONS:
- The GUI is simplistic and primarily functional; aesthetic improvements could enhance user experience.
- Current implementation does not support dynamic reconfiguration of the number of floors or elevators during runtime.
